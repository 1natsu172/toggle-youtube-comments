# Goals

Goals help us figure out what to work on, how to design the product,
what to say no to, and where we need help.

<dl>
  <dt>Just works</dt>
  <dd>Support all video pages on all YouTube versions. Recover from breaking changes as quickly as possible. Talk to users and listen to their feedback. Be transparent.</dd>

  <dt>Beautiful</dt>
  <dd>Blend in with YouTube's visual design. The UI should appear as if it were built by YouTube itself, rather than standing out as being added by a third party.</dd>

  <dt>User friendly</dt>
  <dd>Keep it simple, easy to use, and accessible to everyone. No instructions necessary. Software should be hard to build and easy to use, not the other way around.</dd>

  <dt>Lightweight</dt>
  <dd>We have earned the trust of every user. Respect them by using as little resources as possible on their machine. Favour focus over features. Never collect data without their consent.</dd>

  <dt>Avoid configuration</dt>
  <dd>Absorb complexity on behalf of users. Figure out what the user really wants and reduce the cognitive burden of making decisions. Anything added dilutes everything else.</dd>
